# Employee Attrition Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition using machine learning and data visualization techniques.
It includes a cleaned dataset, a Jupyter Notebook for model building and feature analysis, a Power BI dashboard, and supporting files.

# ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- cleaned_dataset.csv â€“ Preprocessed dataset ready for analysis.

- CW.ipynb â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature importance analysis, and model building.

- dashboard.pbix â€“ Power BI dashboard providing interactive visual insights.

- feature_importance.csv â€“ CSV file highlighting important features impacting attrition prediction.

- WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv â€“ Original raw dataset.

# ðŸ“Š Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- Power BI
